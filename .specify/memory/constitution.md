# Portfolio CMS Site Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Security-First
All development and deployment processes MUST prioritize security. OIDC authentication is mandatory for CI/CD - no IAM access keys shall be used. All traffic MUST be served over HTTPS. S3 buckets MUST use CloudFront OAC to prevent direct access. Credentials and sensitive information MUST NEVER be committed to the repository.

### II. Performance-First
The portfolio site MUST load quickly and provide excellent user experience. Static site generation is required for optimal performance. CloudFront CDN MUST be used for global content delivery. Images MUST be optimized for web delivery. All code MUST be minified and optimized for production.

### III. Maintainability
Code MUST be clean, well-structured, and follow established conventions. TypeScript MUST be used for type safety where applicable. Infrastructure as Code (AWS CDK) is mandatory for all AWS resources. Consistent code formatting and linting MUST be enforced. Dependencies MUST be kept up-to-date and secure.

### IV. Professional Presentation
The portfolio MUST accurately represent professional skills and experience. Content MUST be current and relevant. UI/UX MUST be modern, responsive, and accessible. All certifications and achievements MUST be verified and properly displayed. The site MUST showcase technical competence through its implementation quality.

### V. Infrastructure as Code
All infrastructure MUST be defined and managed through AWS CDK. Manual AWS console changes are prohibited in production. Infrastructure changes MUST be version controlled and peer-reviewed. Deployment processes MUST be automated and repeatable. Environment parity MUST be maintained between development and production.

## Quality Standards

Code quality MUST meet professional standards with proper error handling, logging, and monitoring. All changes MUST be tested before deployment. Performance budgets MUST be respected to maintain fast loading times. Accessibility standards (WCAG) MUST be followed to ensure inclusive design.

## Deployment Requirements

All deployments MUST go through automated CI/CD pipelines. GitHub Actions MUST be used for build and deployment automation. CloudFront cache invalidation MUST occur after each deployment. Rollback procedures MUST be available for critical issues. Deployment logs MUST be preserved for troubleshooting.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices. All code changes MUST be reviewed for compliance with these principles. Infrastructure changes MUST be approved and tested. Security practices are non-negotiable and MUST be enforced at all times. Regular reviews of dependencies and security posture MUST be conducted.
