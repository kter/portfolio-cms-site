# Tasks: 特定商取引法に基づく表記ページ

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-1-abc-123/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Tech stack: Nuxt.js 3, TailwindCSS v3, Vue 3, TypeScript
   → Structure: Static page at /legal-disclosure with footer navigation
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: LegalDisclosure entities and validation rules
   → contracts/: No API contracts needed (static content)
   → research.md: Static implementation with responsive design
   → quickstart.md: Testing scenarios for compliance verification
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Legal page structure and data model
   → Tests: Component tests and E2E compliance verification
   → Core: Page component, data structure, navigation integration
   → Integration: Footer navigation and responsive styling
   → Polish: Accessibility, performance optimization
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
Nuxt.js structure at repository root:
- **Pages**: `pages/legal-disclosure.vue`
- **Components**: `components/LegalDisclosure.vue`
- **Layouts**: `layouts/default.vue` (existing)
- **Tests**: `tests/unit/` and `tests/e2e/`

## Phase 3.1: Setup
- [x] T001 Create legal disclosure data structure in `types/legal-disclosure.ts`
- [x] T002 [P] Configure TypeScript interfaces for all entities from data-model.md
- [x] T003 [P] Set up test directories and configuration for legal compliance testing

## Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD) ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.3
**CRITICAL: These tests MUST be written and MUST FAIL before ANY implementation**
- [x] T004 [P] Unit test for LegalDisclosure component in `tests/unit/legal-disclosure.test.js`
- [x] T005 [P] Unit test for legal data validation in `tests/unit/legal-data-validation.test.js`
- [x] T006 [P] E2E test for page access and navigation in `tests/e2e/legal-disclosure-access.spec.js`
- [x] T007 [P] E2E test for content completeness in `tests/e2e/legal-disclosure-content.spec.js`
- [x] T008 [P] E2E test for responsive design in `tests/e2e/legal-disclosure-responsive.spec.js`

## Phase 3.3: Core Implementation (ONLY after tests are failing)
- [x] T009 Create legal disclosure data in `data/legal-disclosure.ts` with all required business information
- [x] T010 Create LegalDisclosure Vue component in `components/LegalDisclosure.vue`
- [x] T011 Create legal disclosure page in `pages/legal-disclosure.vue`
- [x] T012 Implement responsive layout with TailwindCSS classes
- [x] T013 Add structured data markup for business information

## Phase 3.4: Integration
- [x] T014 Update footer navigation in `layouts/default.vue` to include legal disclosure link
- [x] T015 Add proper meta tags and SEO optimization for legal page
- [x] T016 Implement privacy protection logic for individual business operators
- [x] T017 Add Japanese language content and proper typography

## Phase 3.5: Polish
- [x] T018 [P] Accessibility compliance testing and WCAG 2.1 AA implementation
- [x] T019 [P] Performance optimization for static generation and CDN delivery
- [x] T020 [P] Legal compliance verification against Japanese Specified Commercial Transaction Act
- [x] T021 [P] Cross-browser compatibility testing
- [x] T022 Validate all quickstart.md scenarios are passing

## Dependencies
- Setup (T001-T003) before all other phases
- Tests (T004-T008) before implementation (T009-T013)
- T009 (data structure) blocks T010 (component)
- T010 (component) blocks T011 (page)
- T011 (page) blocks T014 (navigation integration)
- Core implementation before integration (T014-T017)
- Implementation complete before polish (T018-T022)

## Parallel Example
```
# Launch T004-T008 together (all test files):
Task: "Unit test for LegalDisclosure component in tests/unit/legal-disclosure.test.js"
Task: "Unit test for legal data validation in tests/unit/legal-data-validation.test.js"
Task: "E2E test for page access and navigation in tests/e2e/legal-disclosure-access.spec.js"
Task: "E2E test for content completeness in tests/e2e/legal-disclosure-content.spec.js"
Task: "E2E test for responsive design in tests/e2e/legal-disclosure-responsive.spec.js"

# Launch T018-T021 together (different optimization areas):
Task: "Accessibility compliance testing and WCAG 2.1 AA implementation"
Task: "Performance optimization for static generation and CDN delivery"
Task: "Legal compliance verification against Japanese Specified Commercial Transaction Act"
Task: "Cross-browser compatibility testing"
```

## Notes
- No API contracts needed - static content implementation
- All content must comply with Japanese legal requirements
- Individual privacy protection must be configurable
- Responsive design mandatory for professional presentation
- Performance targets: <2s load, 95+ Lighthouse score

## Task Generation Rules Applied
1. **From Data Model**:
   - LegalDisclosure entity → data structure task (T001-T002)
   - BusinessAddress, ContactInformation entities → component structure

2. **From Quickstart Scenarios**:
   - Page access verification → E2E access test (T006)
   - Content completeness → E2E content test (T007)
   - Responsive design → E2E responsive test (T008)

3. **From Research Decisions**:
   - Static Nuxt.js implementation → page and component tasks
   - TailwindCSS styling → responsive layout task
   - TypeScript for type safety → interface definition tasks

4. **Ordering**:
   - Setup → Tests → Data → Components → Pages → Integration → Polish
   - Dependencies ensure proper TDD flow

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked before task execution*

- [x] All entities from data-model.md have corresponding tasks
- [x] All quickstart scenarios have corresponding tests
- [x] Tests come before implementation (TDD enforced)
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent (different files)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] Legal compliance requirements incorporated
- [x] Constitutional principles (performance, security, maintainability) addressed
