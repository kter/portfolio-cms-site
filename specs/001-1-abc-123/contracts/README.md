# Contracts: 特定商取引法に基づく表記ページ

## Overview
This feature implements a static legal disclosure page with no API contracts required.

## Why No API Contracts Are Needed

### Static Content Implementation
The legal disclosure page is implemented as a static Nuxt.js page with:
- Pre-generated content at build time
- No server-side API endpoints
- No client-server data exchange
- No dynamic content loading

### Content Delivery Method
- Static HTML/CSS/JS served via CDN
- Content embedded directly in Vue.js component
- No external API calls required
- No user input or form submissions

### Legal Compliance Considerations
Japanese Specified Commercial Transaction Act requires:
- Static display of business information
- No dynamic content requirements
- Information accessible without user interaction
- Simple HTML page structure sufficient for compliance

## Alternative Implementation Considerations

If future requirements include:
- Dynamic content updates
- Content management system integration
- User interaction features (contact forms)
- Analytics or tracking capabilities

Then API contracts would be needed for:
- Content retrieval endpoints
- Form submission handling
- Analytics data collection
- User interaction tracking

## Testing Approach

Without API contracts, testing focuses on:
- Static content rendering verification
- Responsive design validation
- Accessibility compliance checks
- Legal information completeness verification

## Conclusion

The static nature of legal disclosure requirements makes API contracts unnecessary for this implementation. All required functionality is achieved through standard Nuxt.js static site generation capabilities.
