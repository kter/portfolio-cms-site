## Overview
Research findings for implementing a Japanese Specified Commercial Transaction Act disclosure page in a Nuxt.js portfolio website.

## Legal Compliance Requirements

### Decision: Complete Japanese Legal Disclosure Implementation
**Rationale**: Japanese law requires specific business information disclosure for commercial websites. All mandatory fields must be included to ensure legal compliance.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Partial implementation: Rejected due to legal compliance requirements
- External service integration: Rejected for simplicity and performance

### Required Information Fields

- Email address for inquiries
- Administrative supervisor
- Additional fees and charges
- Return and exchange policies
- Delivery timeframes
- Accepted payment methods
- Payment timing requirements
- Pricing information including tax

## Technical Implementation Approach

### Decision: Nuxt.js Static Page with TailwindCSS
**Rationale**:
- Aligns with existing project technology stack
- Supports static site generation for optimal performance
- TailwindCSS provides responsive design capabilities
- No backend required for static legal content

**Alternatives considered**:
- Separate service: Rejected for unnecessary complexity
- Database-driven content: Rejected as legal content is static
- Third-party legal service: Rejected for cost and control reasons

## Accessibility and User Experience

### Decision: WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional requirement for professional presentation
- Legal disclosure must be accessible to all users
- Portfolio website showcases technical competence

**Implementation approach**:
- Semantic HTML structure
- Proper heading hierarchy
- Sufficient color contrast
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility

## Performance Optimization

### Decision: Minimal JavaScript, Static Generation
**Rationale**:
- Legal page content is purely informational
- Static generation provides fastest loading times
- Minimal client-side JavaScript reduces complexity

**Performance targets**:
- <2s initial page load
- <100ms page transitions
- 95+ Lighthouse performance score

## Mobile Responsiveness

### Decision: Mobile-First Responsive Design
**Rationale**:
- Legal compliance information must be accessible on all devices
- Portfolio website serves professional audience across devices
- TailwindCSS provides efficient responsive utilities

**Breakpoints**:
- Mobile: 320px-768px
- Tablet: 768px-1024px
- Desktop: 1024px+

## Content Management Strategy

### Decision: Component-Based Static Content
**Rationale**:
- Legal content changes infrequently
- Version control provides audit trail for legal compliance
- Component structure allows for easy updates when required

**Alternatives considered**:
- CMS integration: Rejected for unnecessary complexity
- JSON configuration: Rejected for maintenance overhead
- External API: Rejected for performance and reliability concerns

## Testing Strategy

### Decision: Comprehensive Testing for Legal Compliance
**Rationale**:
- Legal compliance cannot be compromised
- All mandatory fields must be verified present
- Responsive design must be tested across devices

**Testing approach**:
- Unit tests for component rendering
- E2E tests for complete user flows
- Accessibility testing with automated tools
- Visual regression testing for layout consistency

## SEO and Discovery

### Decision: Standard Web Page with Appropriate Meta Tags
**Rationale**:

- Legal information changes infrequently
- Manual updates ensure accuracy and legal review
- Git history provides audit trail for compliance

**Process**:
1. Legal information review
2. Code update with proper testing
3. Peer review for accuracy
4. Deployment through standard CI/CD pipeline

## Conclusion

All research findings support a straightforward implementation using existing Nuxt.js infrastructure with static content generation. The approach balances legal compliance requirements with performance optimization and maintainability principles outlined in the project constitution.
