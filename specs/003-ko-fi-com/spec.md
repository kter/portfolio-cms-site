# Feature Specification: Ko-fi Support Button

**Feature Branch**: `003-ko-fi-com`
**Created**: 2025-09-30
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Ko-fi.com„ÅÆSupport Me„ÅÆ„Éï„É≠„Éº„Éà„Éú„Çø„É≥„Çíbottom left„Å´ÂÆüË£Ö„Åó„Å¶„Åè„Å†„Åï„ÅÑ„ÄÇ Ko-fi.com„Åã„ÇâÊèê‰æõ„Åï„Çå„Åü„Çπ„ÇØ„É™„Éó„Éà„ÅØÊ¨°„ÅÆÈÄö„Çä„Åß„Åô„ÄÇ<script src='https://storage.ko-fi.com/cdn/scripts/overlay-widget.js'></script>
<script>
  kofiWidgetOverlay.draw('kterr', {
    'type': 'floating-chat',
    'floating-chat.donateButton.text': 'Support me',

    'floating-chat.donateButton.text-color': '#fff'
  });
</script>"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A site visitor wants to support the portfolio owner financially through Ko-fi. They see a floating "Support me" button positioned at the bottom left corner of the website. When clicked, this button opens a Ko-fi donation interface where they can make a contribution.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a visitor lands on any page of the portfolio website, **When** the page loads, **Then** a floating "Support me" button appears at the bottom left corner
2. **Given** the floating button is visible, **When** a visitor clicks on it, **Then** the Ko-fi donation interface opens
3. **Given** the Ko-fi interface is open, **When** a visitor completes or cancels the donation, **Then** the interface closes and they can continue browsing the site
4. **Given** a visitor is browsing on mobile, **When** they view any page, **Then** the floating button is visible and positioned appropriately at the bottom left without blocking content
5. **Given** a visitor scrolls through a page, **When** the page content moves, **Then** the floating button remains fixed at the bottom left position

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the button overlaps with other fixed-position UI elements at the bottom left?
- How does the button behave when the viewport is very small (e.g., small mobile devices)?
- What happens if the Ko-fi external script fails to load? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should there be a fallback or error handling?]
- Should the button be visible on all pages, or excluded from certain pages? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Display behavior on specific pages not specified]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a floating "Support me" button on the website
- **FR-002**: Button MUST be positioned at the bottom left corner of the viewport
- **FR-003**: Button MUST remain visible and fixed at the bottom left when users scroll
- **FR-004**: Button MUST use the Ko-fi username 'kterr' for directing donations
- **FR-005**: Button MUST display the text "Support me" in white color
- **FR-006**: Button MUST have a background color of #00b9fe (cyan blue)
- **FR-007**: Button MUST use the 'floating-chat' widget type from Ko-fi
- **FR-008**: System MUST load the Ko-fi overlay widget functionality from Ko-fi's CDN
- **FR-009**: Button MUST be clickable and open the Ko-fi donation interface when clicked
- **FR-010**: Button MUST be visible across all pages of the website [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should this appear on every page or exclude certain pages like admin/error pages?]
- **FR-011**: Button MUST be responsive and visible on mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
- **FR-012**: Button MUST not interfere with existing website functionality or navigation

## Notes

### Clarifications Needed
1. **Error handling**: What should happen if the Ko-fi script fails to load? Should there be a fallback message or silent failure?
2. **Page visibility**: Should the button appear on every page without exception, or should it be excluded from specific pages (e.g., error pages, admin interfaces if they exist)?
3. **Overlap management**: If there are other fixed UI elements at the bottom left, how should conflicts be handled?

### Dependencies
- External dependency on Ko-fi CDN availability
- Ko-fi account 'kterr' must be active and valid
