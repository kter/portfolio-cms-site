# Research: Legal Disclosure Page Direct Access Issue

## Problem Analysis

### Current State
- **Page exists**: `/pages/legal-disclosure.vue` is present and properly configured
- **Navigation works**: Page accessible when navigating from main site
- **Direct access fails**: Returns "Access Denied" when accessing https://tomohiko.io/legal-disclosure directly
- **SSG configuration**: Page is included in prerender routes: `['/','legal-disclosure']`

### Root Cause Investigation

**Decision**: The issue is likely related to static hosting configuration, not the Nuxt.js application
**Rationale**:
- The Vue page component exists and is properly configured
- Nuxt.config.ts includes the route in prerender configuration
- Navigation from main site works, indicating the page renders correctly
- "Access Denied" suggests a server/CDN-level restriction

**Alternatives considered**:
1. Vue Router configuration issue - Rejected: navigation works fine
2. Nuxt.js SSG generation issue - Partially ruled out: page is in prerender config
3. Server/CDN access control - Most likely: direct access blocked at infrastructure level

### Research Findings

#### Nuxt.js 3 Static Site Generation Best Practices
**Decision**: Current configuration appears correct for SSG
**Rationale**:
- `ssr: true` enables server-side rendering during build
- `nitro.prerender.routes` includes the legal-disclosure route
- Page structure follows Nuxt.js conventions

#### Common Static Hosting Issues
**Decision**: Issue is likely CloudFront/S3 configuration or referrer-based restrictions
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional requirement for S3 + CloudFront architecture
- "Access Denied" is typical S3/CloudFront error message
- Working through navigation suggests referrer-based or cache-based restriction

#### Investigation Areas
1. **CloudFront Distribution Settings**: Check if there are origin request policies or behaviors restricting direct access
2. **S3 Bucket Policies**: Verify if bucket policies block direct object access
3. **Nitro Output Configuration**: Ensure proper static file generation
4. **Build Process**: Verify that legal-disclosure page is actually generated during build

### Technical Requirements

#### Must Verify
- Static build output includes legal-disclosure/index.html or legal-disclosure.html
- CloudFront distribution allows direct access to all routes
- S3 bucket policy permits CloudFront access to all objects
- No referrer-based restrictions in CloudFront behaviors

#### Must Test
- Direct URL access returns 200 status code
- Page content identical whether accessed directly or via navigation
- SEO meta tags properly rendered for direct access
- Performance impact minimal (static file serving)

## Next Steps for Phase 1

1. **Examine build output** to confirm static generation creates proper files
2. **Design test cases** to verify direct access functionality
3. **Create configuration updates** for any identified issues
4. **Plan deployment verification** to ensure fix works in production environment
