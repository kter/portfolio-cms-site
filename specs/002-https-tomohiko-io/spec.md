# Feature Specification: Fix Legal Disclosure Page Direct Access

**Feature Branch**: `002-https-tomohiko-io`
**Created**: 2025-09-29
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "https://tomohiko.io/legal-disclosure„Å´Áõ¥„Åß„Ç¢„ÇØ„Çª„Çπ„Åô„Çã„Å®Accedd Denied„Å´„Å™„Çä„Åæ„Åô„ÄÇhttps://tomohiko.io/„Åã„Çâ„É™„É≥„ÇØ„ÇíËæø„Çã„Å®Ë°®Á§∫„Åß„Åç„Åæ„Åô„ÄÇÂïèÈ°å„Çí‰øÆÊ≠£„Åó„ÄÅÁõ¥„Åß„Ç¢„ÇØ„Çª„Çπ„Åó„Å¶„ÇÇË°®Á§∫„Åß„Åç„Çã„Çà„ÅÜ„Å´„Åó„Å¶„Åè„Å†„Åï„ÅÑ"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a website visitor, I want to directly access the legal disclosure page at https://tomohiko.io/legal-disclosure so that I can view the legal information without having to navigate through the main website first.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has the direct URL https://tomohiko.io/legal-disclosure, **When** they visit the URL directly in their browser, **Then** the legal disclosure page should load successfully without any access denied errors
2. **Given** a user accesses https://tomohiko.io/legal-disclosure from an external link or bookmark, **When** the page loads, **Then** it should display the same content as when accessed through navigation from the main site
3. **Given** a user visits https://tomohiko.io and navigates to the legal disclosure page, **When** they access it through the site navigation, **Then** it should continue to work as it currently does

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user visits the legal disclosure page with different referrer headers?
- How does the system handle direct access attempts from different user agents or devices?
- What occurs if the user has disabled JavaScript or cookies?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow direct access to the legal disclosure page via https://tomohiko.io/legal-disclosure URL without authentication or referrer restrictions
- **FR-002**: System MUST serve the same legal disclosure content whether accessed directly or through site navigation
- **FR-003**: System MUST not return "Access Denied" errors for direct URL access to the legal disclosure page
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing navigation paths to the legal disclosure page
- **FR-005**: System MUST ensure the legal disclosure page loads within reasonable response time when accessed directly [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific performance target not specified]

### Key Entities
- **Legal Disclosure Page**: A publicly accessible webpage containing legal information that must be available through direct URL access
- **URL Route**: The specific path /legal-disclosure that must be accessible without restrictions
